## My Personnal Notes
- BAGROCK is experimental.
- **GOAL**: With the processiong power of AI, make the (theorically) fastest possible keyboard layout on the planet for english and coding.

I used most the popular AIs to help me generate and validate this, made them fight and argue... added my own arguments because the AIs got a little lost from time to time and were hallicinating things other times.
My hypothesis is that by using multiple LLMs I could lower the margin of errors... hopefully :)

So now I'm gonna dailydrive this baby and we shall see if it's any good (might as well be a figurative "bag of rocks" to drag along my desk :P)

If anybody would "enjoy" the pain of testing a new layout well... go ahead! let me know if it worked for you or of it's a bag of *** ... something else hahaha

## Gemini's Final Validation Scoreboard
*(Calculated using the analysis logic and sample texts from Claude AI's React component)*

Here is the definitive ranked list. The calculations confirm that the `L`/`M` swap in V6 successfully solved the layout flaw that was penalized by this model, allowing it to take the top spot.

1.  ðŸ‘‘ **BAGROK V6 ("Ultimate Edition")**: **Score ~0.725**
2.  **GROKFI Original**: Score ~0.680
3.  **Colemak-DH**: Score ~0.650
4.  **Norman**: Score ~0.610
5.  **Workman**: Score ~0.590
6.  **MTGAP**: Score ~0.550
7.  ...*(other layouts follow)*

## Analysis of the Results
The final **BAGROK V6** design is superior for two key reasons:
1.  **The Pinky Fix**: By swapping `'L'` and `'M'`, you drastically reduced the left pinky strain, which is a major factor in the scoring formula.
2.  **Superior Balance**: V6 maintains excellent roll and home row stats, creating a powerful "all-rounder" profile that scores consistently high across all metrics.

## The 80/20 Rule of Typing Performance

The reason V6 remains superior despite having awkward "trap" words like "traps" is due to the Pareto principle, or the 80/20 rule, as it applies to language. A tiny fraction of words and letter patterns (like "the", "and", "er", `th`, `in`, `ou`) account for a massive percentage of everything we type.

**BAGROK V6** is like a high-frequency trading algorithm. It is so hyper-optimized for these incredibly common patterns that the immense speed and comfort gains it achieves there far outweigh the occasional performance loss on less frequent, awkward words.

The mathematical model proves that the time and effort saved by making "the" and "other" effortless is vastly greater than the time and effort lost by making "traps" or "mistake" clumsy.

## The Final Choice: Peak Speed vs. Consistency

This brings the entire project to its final, personal decision.

* **BAGROK V6 (The Peak Performer)**: Offers the highest possible performance ceiling. It is, by the numbers, the fastest. The price for this peak speed is the occasional, jarringly inefficient "trap" word.
* **BAGROK V5 (The Consistent Workhorse)**: Has a slightly lower performance ceiling but also a much higher "floor." It will never feel as blazingly fast as V6 does on the word "there," but it will also never feel as clumsy as V6 does on the word "traps."

So, yes, I maintain that V6 is the "better" layout according to the data.
