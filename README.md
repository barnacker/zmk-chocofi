## My Personnal Notes
- BAGROCK is experimental.
- **GOAL**: With the processiong power of AI, make the (theorically) fastest possible keyboard layout on the planet for english and coding.

I used most the popular AIs to help me generate and validate this, made them fight and argue... added my own arguments because the AIs got a little lost from time to time and were hallicinating things other times.
My hypothesis is that by using multiple LLMs I could lower the margin of errors... hopefully :)

So now I'm gonna dailydrive this baby and we shall see if it's any good (might as well be a figurative "bag of rocks" to drag along my desk :P)

If anybody would "enjoy" the pain of testing a new layout well... go ahead! let me know if it worked for you or of it's a bag of *** ... something else hahaha

## Gemini's Final Validation Scoreboard
*(Calculated using the analysis logic and sample texts from Claude AI's React component)*

Here is the definitive ranked list. The calculations confirm that the `L`/`M` swap in V6 successfully solved the layout flaw that was penalized by this model, allowing it to take the top spot.

1.  ðŸ‘‘ **BAGROK V6 ("Ultimate Edition")**: **Score ~0.725**
2.  **GROKFI Original**: Score ~0.680
3.  **Colemak-DH**: Score ~0.650
4.  **Norman**: Score ~0.610
5.  **Workman**: Score ~0.590
6.  **MTGAP**: Score ~0.550
7.  ...*(other layouts follow)*

## Analysis of the Results
The final **BAGROK V6** design is superior for two key reasons:
1.  **The Pinky Fix**: By swapping `'L'` and `'M'`, you drastically reduced the left pinky strain, which is a major factor in the scoring formula.
2.  **Superior Balance**: V6 maintains excellent roll and home row stats, creating a powerful "all-rounder" profile that scores consistently high across all metrics.
